### Random Notes
- Flask templating is really easy to do! I think it makes creating a web app so convenient
- I really like this demo! Following from the class example & translating it to the dream journal project
- I've had SQL experience before, so I'm excited to see it be used for this project!
- Styling was very easy, my prior CSS experience came in handy
- Adding the database was much easier than I imagined
- Hosting on Glitch was super convenient for me
